# Smart-Wheelchair-with-Arduino
"Smart wheelchair" is the final year graduation thesis for my Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Engineering). The entire process, including design, implementation, and demonstration, is part of the thesis for educational purposes only.

Smart wheelchair interface is to allow the user to control the mobility of the chair in less effort and more robustness and safety. Smart wheelchair consists of a major controller unit which allows the user to provide the input in the form of joystick or button. User can choose two functions, auto mode or manual mode. The controller unit then synthesizes the command and takes the required action so as to move the wheelchair to the particular position. Each rare wheel of smart wheelchair is attached with a motor which acquires required power from battery connected to respective motors. The wheelchair is also provided with obstacle detection system which reduces the chance of collision while on the journey. Battery is used as power supply.
