# Smart-Wheelchair-with-Arduino
"Smart wheelchair" is the final year graduation thesis for my Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Engineering). The entire process, including design, implementation, and demonstration, is part of the thesis for educational purposes only.

Smart wheelchair interface is to allow the user to control the mobility of the chair in less effort and more robustness and safety. A smart wheelchair is a powered wheelchair to which sensors and assistive technology are attached. Smart wheelchair consists of an Arduino Uno board which allows the user to control it by using joystick or button. User can choose two functions, auto mode or manual mode. Arduino Uno takes decision from joystick or line follower sensor and sends control signal to motor driver circuit to drive motor. Each rare wheel of smart wheelchair is attached with a MY1016Z motor which acquires required power from battery connected to respective motors. Ultrasonic sensor is also made a part of the design and it helps to detect obstacles lying ahead in the way of the wheelchair that can hinder the motion of the wheelchair. 12V YTX7A- BS battery is used as power supply.

The aim and objectives of my thesis,"Smart Wheelchair" are as follows:
* To study sensors with Arduino
* To design and implement a user-controlled wheelchair with self-mobility
* To provide an opportunity for mobility-impaired people to move from one place to
another without depending on others for their movement as a daily need
* To support nursing homes where the old age people have difficulty in their
movements
